|---> it runs the code line by line
|---> it executes on a single thread / comparetively slow than other languages
|---> This is is default javascript concepts
```

## Execution Context
```javascript
|---> execute one line of code at a time
    |--> console log-1
    |--> console log-2

    // each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing new line
```
